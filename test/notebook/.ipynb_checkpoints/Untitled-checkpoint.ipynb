The first time it rained after I used RainX was on a cross-country trip last week, and amazingly it almost completely eliminated the need to use windshield wipes even during downpours. Water drops still land on the windshield, but immediately rolls off whenever the car is moving, leaving a very clear view through the windshield - much clearer than even with wipers on high. For those who have flown small planes, the effect is much the same, and why such planes don't even have wipers. (At air speeds, wind pushes raindrops off the windshield very nicely all by itself.)The only time we needed to use the wipers in several days of rain and snow driving was when passing trucks, as those covered the windshield with clouds of tiny droplets that were hard to see through.A week later, I'm noticing the windshield no longer clears itself at speeds under 40 MPH, so it may be due for another treatment, but still stays nicely clear at highway speeds, and is very easy to clear at lower speeds with a single pass of the wipers.\",\n",

Have used this in the past on all of my vehicles (3 over the last 16 years) and it does a great job of clearing your windshield/windows of rain and misting.During light rains or when the roads are wet and mist is kicked up from the tires on the vehicle in front of you, this does a great job of keeping the beading moving up and off of the windows to the point that you don't really even need your wipers.  In moderate or heavy rains, it does a great job of keeping the water beaded up so vision isn't as reduced as it is on untreated windows.I docked one star though because i've found (thru multiple vehicles and uses) that my wiper blades doesn't seem to last as long after it has been applied.  I've also spoken with multiple friends who reported the same issue.  I haven't used this in conjunction with the RainX wiper blades so maybe that isn't an issue if you use them, but it is def noticeable with other commons brands... From the cheapest ones to the premium ones, it seems to affect the life of them all.That being said, i now only apply to the side windows, moonroof and mirrors of my vehicles. The beading the product causes helps keep the rain off which minimizes water spots as well.

It comes in a plastic tube which serves as a holder for the Absorber and I would suggest you store it in there since the Absorber should be stored moist so it does not break down and stiffen.  The product really does absorb a lot of water and is the best car dryer I have ever had.  After you wash the car run the Absorber over the car and 90% of the water gets removed.  When the towel gets saturated, just wring it out and start drying again.  It cuts car drying time at least in half, maybe more, plus the effort to dry with this towel is less than with a standard towel or chamois.  If the car is in the sun or if you have hard water or if you are meticulous about your car, it may be a good thing to run a microfiber towel over the car after you use the Absorber to get the rest of the water off and to ensure no spots/streaks get  left behind.  When you are done, just wring most of the water out of the Absorber and roll it back into its plastic container for next time.  This is a great product for car drying or for cleaning up wet spills.  I highly recommended it for those purposes.  I am hesitant to recommend using it on your body since it sits in a moist, bacteria-friendly environment between uses - but as a car dryer it is terrific.

If you wring it out (edges too) it doesn't streak, leave water behind, and works about as well as a natural chamois. It will also last for years if left damp and stored in the plastic container, (nope don't dry it). Then why use a natural chamois?  Well for me there is something about the shine left behind with a natural chamois. I'm 69 years old and have used those since a teenager. Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa)  I do recommend it. Hope this helps someone.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Works great for drying the car quickly and easily when its not hot enough out to do it quickly, and you don't wanna have to polish out all the water spots afterwords (Black car). This thing absorbs so much water you won't believe it till you use it, and it just takes a beating and keeps on going. When I first used it I was afraid I was gonna rip it by twisting the water out too hard, nope, just keep wringing it out until its dry and continue on.A little secret to using it, at least I've found it to work better this way. When drying the car, lay the Absorber out flat (unfold it across the surface) and then grasp it at one end at each corner and drag it slowly across the car allowing it to absorb all the water it comes into contact with. This works especially well on horizontal surfaces, but still good enough on the vertical ones as well. This practice also helps to prevent scratching of the surface when small particles get trapped between the chamois and the paint surface and then your hand comes and pushes it right into the paint.Little warning, when it comes, don't smell it. Mine reeeeekkkkkeeedddd! But I just rinsed it out and the smell went away. Yes it is true that you can put it right back into the tube wet (Well to get it back in the tube, you must, because you can't roll it once it dry), but I like to leave the top off of the tube to allow air in there to dry it out before I close it up and that musty gross smell comes back.Long story short: Get it, you won't be disappointed.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I've been using these things for several years and I buy a new one about every year or so. The Absorber is PVA, so it needs to stay a little wet because it gets very stiff when dry. Once you get used to it and how it works, it's great. There are a lot of PVA drying towels out there that are cheaper, but believe me, this one is superior in thickness and quality. I bought a cheap, generic one at Wal-Mart and it started tearing apart within a couple days.I use mine to wipe down just about anything and everything you'd use a normal towel for. It won't get something as immediately dry to the touch as a towel since it is slightly damp to start with, but evaporation quickly takes care of the rest. The main advantage over a towel is that it works like both a towel and a sponge, depending on how wet it is. It's nice and cool to the touch so it doubles as a cooling cloth in the summer heat. When it gets too wet, you just wring it out. When it gets a little dirty, soak it in a little soap and water and wring it out or throw it in the washer (just make sure you don't put it in the dryer, it comes out of the washer slightly damp, just like it should be stored). Every few washes, I recommend using some bleach in the wash or soaking it with some bleach to help keep it like new.\",\n",

With just the stock mirrors, any traffic directly behind the boat was absolutely invisible to me.  With the mirrors, that is no longer the case.I had two problems initially: one due to my own ineptness and the other due to being alone.  When I first got these out of the box and clipped them into the bottom of the door and the window groove, the horizontal bar was not horizontal at all.  Adjusting the straps straightened that out completely.  Also, the mirrors appeared to be fixed in position and any effort to move them seemed as if it might break them.  Well, there are three Phillips head screws that encircle the adjustment ball; loosen them and you can move the mirror any way you want.The major problem remains adjusting the passenger side mirror.  If I had somebody to move it for me, I could adjust it in just a minute while I sat in the driver's seat.  As it is, I had to get out, adjust the mirror, get back in, check the adjustment from the driver's seat and repeat ad nauseum until I finally got it right.  I don't fault the mirror for that.These mirrors come one to a box so you need to order two of them.  The image vibrates slightly but that doesn't really matter in practice:  I'm just looking to see if anything is behind the boat.  It will tell me that.\",\n",

You must make sure that the feet are adjusted properly. I made marks on my factory mirrors so that I install them in the same spot every time. Once installed make sure the straps are as tight as you can get them. I have had little or no trouble with vibration. Anytime you hang something on a mirror that wasn't intended to have something hanging there and then go down a not so smooth road you are going to get some vibration. I don't care who makes it. This design was well thought out and works great on our 07 Jeep Wrangler. At speeds up to 75 mph I have very little movement to none. The only time I get any vibration or movement is at expansion joints or rough roads. To sum it all up I would make this purchase again and would recommend it to others who have the same type of factory mirrors as mine.

China may or may not lower quality.Bought about three since the first one.  They were copy cats, two I think from HD, junk, total junk.  Felt like they were restricting the flow at any setting.  Poor jet shape or any other compared to original.  Remember I had the old one for comparison which defined \"perfect\".After several throw aways bought another $20 one from Amazon.  Think the metal part is aluminum in old and new if that matters.  The most recent works just like the old one and on less pressure because the first hose bibb in front yard is ahead of the pressure valve all home have.  Whoops, just noticed in the pic here at Amazon, front nozzle is stainless on both of mine but the colored body toward the rear looks like anodized aluminum on both of mine.So China or not I have old and new and they are equal in performance.

I'm not sure exactly when I bought it, but it was definitely no later than 2009.I've used it consistently over that time, for washing the car, hosing off the patio by the pool, washing the dog, cleaning the pool filter, etc etc. It's heavy-duty enough to drop on the concrete, it just lands with a dull thud from that thick rubber ring around the end, and years of abuse haven't affected it in the slightest.  The stream selection by rotating the outer ring is still as smooth as the day I bought it.Being able to turn it off at either end of the rotation is a nice feature too, less messing with it when you're done using it.

You can expect water to come out of the hose a full throttle unless you reduce it manually.  My first attempt to use it was with a small diameter hose and they are not the best to use for a nozzle that uses a standard hose.  The small diameter would not permit pressure buildup inside the hose and therefore the exit of water was at a much smaller volume than a standard hose.  No big thing.  Then I used the standard hose and the nozzle would at best take the stream over the second story of the house with no problems.  While the stream was not a great as I would like it at least got there thusly making this nozzle super for getting at the upper windows.  Next, I placed the nozzle on the front of a hose end sprayer to test its ability to handle liquid weeder, fertilizer or detergent.  It did far better than the nozzle that comes with the hose end sprayer.  Old happy gardener.  When comparing the price of the unit to other available sprayers of similar quality I would have to go with some of the cheaper ones that are made of metal and not plastic.  Some, however, plastic sprayers are not all that bad and one heckuva lot cheaper than the almost $25 for this nozzle.  While it is not perfect, it does the job for what I specifically want to use it for.  Also, I used it on the truck to clean it and it did a decent job except in an effort to preserve water it is something of a pain to have to screw the nozzle each time you want to cut the water off.  In fact, it is doubtful that this nozzle will see vehicle washing again.',\n",

It's good for watering plants too, using the fan end of the selector range. If you get it just right you can actually get it to mist too.The only thing this nozzle is missing is a quick on/off mechanism. As it is, you turn it off by rotating the front to one end or the other. This is the same mechanism used to select the spray pattern. This is a design improvement over the original, which only had the off position at one end of the spray selection.The rubber coated aluminum design is very sturdy and will last for years... the last one did. The only reason I had to replace the last one was my mistake... I left it attached to the hose for a few years and either the hard water or electrolysis caused it to become permanently stuck to the brass end of the hose, and it got damaged when I tried to remove it.

For a start, there is no quick way to get the desired spray pattern, you have to slowly rotate the head and stop when you think it is what you need, often messing around 'finely tuning' it to try and get the best result. Secondly, none of the 'jet' part of the adjustments creates a clean jet, there is always a fine mist or errant second or third jet spraying in a different direction at the same time.These cannot create all the spray patterns found on a 7 way nozzle, and create poor patterns on the ones they can create.This is a good idea, but in reality you are better off with a 7 way nozzle.\",\n",

You adjust the flow of water by turning the spray head at the front.  Water flow can be cut off at either end of the range, as the flow pattern goes from off, to a gentle sprinkle, to wide spray, and then narrowing into a beam, and then off again.  Because of the larger sized head, the \"ultimate\" nozzle has a larger area of coverage, and can deliver a larger volume of water.The nozzle does a decent job of diffusing water flow, producing a nice gentle flowing fountain of water suitable for watering potted plants or delicate flowers.  When adjusted more to a spray, it is well suited for vegetable gardens and general use.  This is however, nothing unique as far as sprinkler nozzles go.Fully open, the front aperture is about 0.12 inches in diameter, which produces a thicker stream of water than your typical cheapo nozzle.  Sometimes a thick stream is advantageous, but you will be using more water, and the increased water pressure may stress your plumbing.  Unless your system has high volume, and good water pressure, you may not be able to take full advantage this nozzle.The nozzle appears to be solidly built, and seems to work as advertised.  Unfortunately the aluminum parts on mine have a reddish finish, rather than green, which looks cooler.  Although it can deliver a higher volume of water, the assertion that it is the \"ultimate\" is perhaps an overstatement.  It does a good job, but not that much better than the various cheapo nozzles and spray guns.  The economy models typically don\\'t last very long, so if \"the ultimate\" proves to be durable, it might be worth the premium cost.  It\\'s a bit heavy, and encourages using more water, so at this point I like it more than love it.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I avoided dynamat for the longest time because it's pricey for the coverage area.  However after researching this, it's not easy to find a comparable material.  I covered the interior walls of my dryer (I posted a photo above) and it reduced the low rumbling noise considerably.  Dynamat Xtreme is a butyl rubber compound covered by aluminum foil.  The butyl is viscoelastic - it has just the right consistency between solid and liquid to provide maximum sound damping.  The foil probably provides some level of fire resistance, since it is hard for a fire to develop without oxygen when it is sandwiched in between the metal layer.  Cheap alternatives that some people use include the asphalt based rolls of roof sealer.  However that stuff will smell bad when it heats up (whereas butyl doesn't have such odor) and it doesn't have an aluminum layer so it's more dangerous if it were to catch fire, and asphalt can ooze into a liquid.  The closest thing I have come across that resembles Dynamat Xtreme is Hard Cast Foil Grip 1402, a specialty tape sold to contractors for HVAC duct sealing.  This HVAC tape, a favorite of mine for all kind of sealing uses, is much thinner though.  It's also a butyl compound with a foil layer and is also very expensive.  Overall I haven't found any hardware store generic material that is as good as Dynamat Xtreme for sound damping on large panels.  The price here is pretty good - I called around to some local retailers and they wanted almost twice as much for this kit.\",\n",

I was slightly worried when I first ordered because I did my research and knew this was the case. I ordered anyways because of the lack of reviews on other types of horns out there. I put these on the front of my Hyundai Elantra and completely removed the stock horn.Keep in mind that the only thing that comes in the box is a pair of horns (high tone and low tone) and a relay. USE THE RELAY. You might think that the power going to the stock horn is sufficient but run a volt meter to it, when the horn is pressed, and chances are you are getting less than 12V. Just as you would think the extra power just creates a louder horn.I got all of my supplies from Home Depot. A 36x1\" bar of steel and 2 nuts and bolts. I cut this down and drilled two holes to mount my horns to because I didn\\'t have room in the stock location. I also got a spool of red wire and a spool of black wire 14 gauge (a little oversized, you\\'d be fine with 16 or 18), some heat shrink, and connectors to plug into the horn, relay, and attach to the battery and grounding points. I took my time and made sure that all of my connections were crimped, soldered, and shrinked very well. I found a location by the battery for the relay and hooked everything up.These horns sound great. With the dual tones alone more people will notice these but they are probably 50% louder than my stock horn. The quality looks fantastic. I would certainly order another set. Install took me ~2 hours including run time to home depot and I was taking my time.Just Google search for the wiring diagram and ideas of how to mount them.[...]',\n",

Remember that the weight of the vehicle is divided up amongst the stands. With the exception of the very biggest configuration of the very biggest 1 ton diesel pickup available most big non-commerical trucks weigh less than 1 ton per corner so even if these stands can only manage a third of their rated weight they are still overkill for most trucks let alone cars.Basically the welds should be better but these things are still very strong and perfectly fine for normal passenger vehicles.\",\n",

Not sure if it is the same exact formula as the white bottle and it very well could be, but I will update this when I clean the older filter again which i just cleaned with the white recharge kit so it won't be for a while.

I\\'m here to say that the squeeze bottle isn\\'t a perfect solution either. I had to oil the Ducati Performance air filter for my 696, which is just a basic cylindrical filter except the \"dirty\" air comes in from the inside out. A typical conical filter on a car has the dirt collecting on the outside. The airbox on the 696 is set up so the dirt comes from the inside of the filter. This made it extremely difficult to oil properly.On a car filter, oiling the pleats evenly takes a lot of time and excess oil still tends to seep out. It takes some practice, time, and patience - probably a second filter doesn\\'t hurt either.Overall: 4/5 stars, still difficult to oil the filter uniformly but easier to control versus the aerosol spray',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Lexol Leather conditioner contains special oils that rejuvenates and softens leather surfaces. It is easy to use and the instructions on the bottle provide the optimal application method. I have a leather wrapped steering wheel that has grown stiff due to its exposure to dry summer heat over the years. I had been using Black Magic's Leather Conditioner/Cleaner combo and some other OTC products without much success. The Lexol pH cleaner worked well to clean the leather, and the conditioner was just amazing. It turned the leather almost brand new and all of the creases were soft again. I recommend using a terry cloth or cotton cloth to apply it onto surfaces. The Lexol conditioner is an amber liquid that is only slightly more viscous than water and has a unique smell.Pros: Very easy to use, and works as advertised. It should be the only leather conditioner you use - the over the counter stuff doesn't work.Cons: Hard to find and expensive, but Amazon carries them at a low price.Overall: If you own any leather accessories or cars with interior leathers, Lexol pH cleaner and Lexol conditions are must-buy items.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don\\'t be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It\\'s MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won\\'t have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren\\'t electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn\\'t mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn\\'t.The technical stuff.  Don\\'t worry if this doesn\\'t make sense, you don\\'t really need to know all of this, but I\\'m trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I\\'m not an electrican but I\\'ve worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can\\'t control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it\\'s low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it\\'s a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you\\'d be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25\\' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn\\'t as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman\\'s terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it\\'s 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we\\'re trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don\\'t attach it directly to the battery\\'s NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!  They are inexpensive and top notch quality!',\n",

       "  'text': \"All other jumper cables are not real jumper cables.  THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.  There's always time the next day to roll these monsters back up and get them ready for the next wild adventure you might have.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'So these aren\\'t the best cables you can buy.  For that you\\'ll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I\\'d say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don\\'t really seem that much thicker...  That\\'s said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I\\'m guessing that\\'s why the thickness isn\\'t much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It\\'s a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that\\'s kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don\\'t have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they\\'ll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don\\'t like:--Stiffness - They\\'re not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That\\'s why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn\\'t go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It\\'s screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I\\'m sure.So why buy these cables aren\\'t they overkill?  I\\'ve had this argument with people before: \"My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.\"  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn\\'t automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren\\'t aware (and I\\'m not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that\\'s good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable\\'s strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50\\'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won\\'t work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don\\'t want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6\\' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I\\'ve personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25\\' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25\\' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe.',\n",

I originally thought I would use it to pour gas into lawn care devices but when it arrived my wife had a need for a funnel to use in the kitchen. She scrubbed it thoroughly and it worked fine for her. In addition, she said it looked like one of the old time hearing aids. Amazingly, she was right on target. By holding the small end to my ear I could clearly hear her, the TV and the telephone. To my utter surprise all sounds are clearly amplified. I never would have believed it if I had not experienced this for myself. There are some frequencies which I have some difficulty in hearing now that I have \"matured\". My wife\\'s voice is one of them so this is a handy aid when I want to hear something that she does not clearly elucidate. For convenience it even has a loop on the wide end where I can insert a chain or rope to hang around my neck. The uses for this item are nearly endless and I will order another one to serve the original purpoe for which I bought this one which is for pouring gas and oil.This is truly a multi-purpose tool and at a bargain price.',\n",

I am also convinced that Fords have a damn trickle as this car drains a battery faster than anything else I have seen [maybe not as fast as a snooty BMW].  I spent a hoop of time looking on line for a quality product.  This one was well reviewed on many forums and after going to the factory web page I was convinced.  Amazon had the BEST price period.  I ordered four to start, one for Dad [has a truck he rarely drives], one for car I \"baby-sit\", one of wife\\'s Jeep it sometimes does not get driven for days which is only a concern during cold Illinois winters, and my truck which always is outside [does not fit in garage] and thought it would be a good idea on those super cold nights when I also plug in my battery blanket and oil heater.I installed two so far and it was very easy!  The unit is designed to be permanently mounted under the hood, it comes with a bracket and some screws.  The first thing I did [I know it voids any warranty] is open it up and de-solder three wires from the short 12\" cord and upgrade to a 14 gage 3 conductor cord of adequate single length.  I routed and zip-tied it to blend in with all of the other factory wires and ran it to the front lower valance [bumper] where I fabricated a simple aluminum bracket with grommet pull-through opening and terminated at a plug.  Now to use all I have to do is plug it in, no need to even open the hood.  With it disconnected you can barely see the plug from behind the license plate.  Total time about an hour and a half, if you are less particular I guess you could toss it in and be up and running in 10 minutes.  So far very happy, I have taken some measurements of the capabilities and thay are as claimed.  Almost forget, pics on amazon are not totally accurate, does not gome with a fuse holder for battery side.  I added a 5A blade fuse with all weather holder to the positive side between unit and battery for peace of mind.',\n",

       "  'text': \"I did quite a bit of research before deciding on Dynamat.  There are some cheaper competitors that people swear are just as good and they may be, but I just don't trust them as much.  If you do your research you will even see that some people chose to use roofing material that you can buy at Home Depot.  Someone would have to be OUT OF THEIR MIND to put $20 worth of roofing tar into a $20,000+ vehicle.  The only negative thing people have to say about Dynamat is that it is priced high, but if you buy the bulk packs on Amazon you will save yourself a ton of money and is actually a pretty cost effective solution for DIY work.  I have looked around and Amazon has the best price anywhere.Main competitors and my impressions of them.  I have not purchased or used these product, but this is an idea of why I chose Dynamat over them.  I am not a car audio professional by any means.  This is the first time I used deadening on my car and I am writing this to help anyone else who is thinking of doing this.1) RAAMAudio RAAMmat + Ensolite Foam - Most cost effective &#34;legitimate&#34; option.2) Sound Deadener Showdown - &#34;CDL Tiles&#34; + Mass Loaded Vinyl.  SDS would be an interesting choice.  If you look through forums you will see some people who really like this stuff, but I found the website to be confusing and I could not truly make an informed decision one way or another.3)Fatmat:  Cheapest of all automotive dampeners, but one Google search of &#34;fatmat smell&#34; is all you need to know.  Some say it smells awful and some don't, but there is no chance I risk it.  This stuff is super cheap, does not deaden as well as competitors and stinks.  I would use home depot roofing material before this product.  Move on.And to the &#34;REAL&#34; competitor.4) Second Skin Audio- Damplifier Pro + Closed Cell Foam (CCF)-  Although I decided on dynamat, based on reviews and forum comments, I think that Second Skin Audios product line may in fact be superior to Dynamat, but I decided against it for a few reasons.  Damplifier Pro is a good bit heavier than Dynamat extreme.  For most, this isnt going to make a huge difference, but I am lining a performance car with more emphasis on performance than sound.  I want an improved sound system, but if the increase in weight is only going to improve things very minimally it is just not worth it to me.  A lot of people say that Dynamat is the most expensive, but a 36 sq. foot pack of Damplifier pro costs $204+ shipping.  They do have some coupons occasionally, but it is more expensive.The fact is Dynamat is proven to work and is trusted by professionals.  I do not think you can go wrong with Dynamat because the only bad thing people have to say about it is that the price is high which is a bit of a myth.  If you drive a big truck or SUV, want the absolute best sound and aren't as concerned with weight, I would think about the 80sq foot Damplifier Pro shop pack and CCF foam.I turned my trunk into a enclosure with Dynamat Xtreme.  I lined just about every surface, doubling up in a few critical areas and was able to line my trunk with this kit.  If you want to really go out and line an entire car, you will need 100 sq ft+ of this stuff.  If you are doing the trunk and doors like me, you'll need 50-80 sq feet depending on whether or not you plan to cover the entire door.  I would use the bulk kit for anything but the doors.  You can surely use the Dynamat in the bulk kit on the doors, but the door kit strips 12&#34; x 36&#34; and make for a cleaner install because they will run the full length of any door.  It would not be the end of the world to have extra, but I would try to make a good estimate of how much you will need so that you arent leftover with a whole box of this stuff.One final recommendation as I try to unload all of the information I have learned.  Dynamat claims that you do not need a heat gun to install Dynamat Extreme.  That may be true, but after using a heat gun to put the finishing touches on the trunk, I would have to strongly recommend using a heat gun for trouble areas and difficult corners.  I was able to put the Dynamat down so much flatter and nicer by heating it up a bit and rolling it down.  it especially helps to heat corners and tight spots where you cannot get the roller in, because it makes it easier to mash the Dynamat down with your fingers.  I am not going to use the heat gun on the doors however, as I believe that there are more heat sensitive components in there and do not want to chance it Dynamat claims it is not a necessity.I plan on using Dynaliner on top of the Dynamat in the doors (and trunk I think) as well as by itself in a few areas.  I really hope this helps someone.  If you have anything to say about my opinions, or would just like to comment on what I have done, please let me know.\",\n",

I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be \"excellent.\"  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray\\'d.

       "  'text': \"I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.\",\n",

In other words, when you screw/unscrew the cap onto the car's brake fluid container, there will be kinking on the tube itself. Untangling the kinks is a chore because the bottle is both quite big and heavy when it is filled with brake fluid. They should have designed with some quick-connect/disconnect like the compressor air hose. That would be an ideal solution, but I guess it will add to the cost for adding that feature. However, I doubt that it would cost much because I browsed through the air-hose connectors at Harbor Freight and they run typically a couple of bucks each. I might modify this bleeder with the air hose connector to address the problem.\",\n",

The pressure bottle is a thick plastic that's barely translucent. Nearly pumped air through the entire brake system at the end because I couldn't tell the pressurizer was dry of fresh fluid.2: They really need to ship with a roll of teflon plumbers tape.

You get a higher amount of fluid out each time than using this bleeder. After squeezing the top on it managed to keep 14 PSI (14.5 Recommended for by VW mechanics manual), which literally pushed out 10 drops every minute.If you aren't too sure how to bleed brakes as I stated above, just go on youtube and you'll see what I am talking about.Also the bleeder bottle you can find on amazon as an item frequently bought with this item is worth the money.\",\n",

This filter maintains it low restriction to air flow, even when very dirty. I have these in all of my vehicles, not to save money, but because they stop dirt better and allow more air flow. Cars that sit outside sometimes attract mice that chew up the paper air filter and make a nest. Not possible with the oil soaked K&N.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I have a 1999 Mercedes-Benz C230 that had ~144,000 miles on it.  The idle was very rough and noisy, and the engine wasn\\'t as smooth as it should have been in general, especially at lower engine speeds.  The problem was so bad that the engine would almost stall at idle after first being started.I tried Lucas \"Upper Cyclinder Lubricant and Injector Cleaner\", and it didn\\'t seem to help at all.  Then I put a full 20-oz bottle of Chevron Techron through the fuel tank, and it also seemed to do nothing.  In each case, the product was used as directed, and the car was driven until the fuel level was very low.  That is, I didn\\'t refill the fuel tank and dilute the product in either case.  In the past, I\\'ve also used other brands of fuel system and fuel injector cleaners, including Gumout and STP.  None of these products seemed to have the slightest effect.Finally, and extremely skeptical, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment.  I put a full 16-oz bottle in the fuel tank after filling up.  The improvement was dramatic and immediate.  The engine ran much more smoothly and quietly than before.  The engine no longer idled like a diesel farm tractor.  I was extremely surprised, but still skeptical, because I wasn\\'t sure if it had actually cleaned anything, or if it was simply helping because it was being burned with the fuel.  So, I withheld judgment until the fuel tank had been driven to near-empty and refilled, meaning that the amount of Sea Foam left in the fuel would be negligible.This was no placebo effect.  Even after refueling, the car ran much better than it did before.  It now idles more nicely than my Hyundai, which still seems bizarre to me.  I am extremely pleased, which doesn\\'t happen often, trust me.  I\\'ll be putting a can of Sea Foam Motor Treatment through my fuel tanks before every oil change from now on.My other car, a Hyundai Sonata, had an annoying ticking sound when it would idle, especially when cold.  I would have described the sound as a \"lifter tick\", but I\\'m not sure what it was--a sticking valve?  I don\\'t know; I\\'m no mechanic.  I added the recommended amount of Sea Foam to the crankcase, and the sound went away immediately, or nearly so.  I\\'ve since changed the oil in that car, and the sound has not returned.Some people criticize Sea Foam based on its age.  I find these criticisms ridiculous--as if \"older\" equates with \"worse\".  Do these people ever address the actual chemistry of the product, or provide actual reasons for their disapproval?  No, they just complain about how long it\\'s been around.Sea Foam made me a believer.  Very highly recommended!',\n",

For about the past 6 months, I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success, so I gave it a shot.  I added a can to the fuel tank, and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake.  Let it sit and drove it around.  It smoked like crazy as promised.Now, anecdotally, I do think it smoothed out my idle and I haven't had a hard start.  But, there is nothing I can quantify, and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological.  I think my truck runs better if I wax it.  My use also coincided with the end of winter, so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements, too.  I did not see an improvement in mpg.So, if this is where my story ended, I'd say give it a go.  If it works, great.  If not, you didn't lose too much.BUT...The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor.  To be fair, the truck has 100k, and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor.  Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg, the sensor was likely on its way out.  At the same time, I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles.  My personal belief is that the big blast of smoke just pushed a failing sensor over the edge.So, no, I won't use this stuff again.  Most people have had fine luck, but its not worth the risk for me.\",\n",

It is the contaminents that circulate in tanks nowadays this helps rid your fuel system of . If nothing else it makes me feel better to use it . I put it in all gasoline for all equipment and vehicles in my household especially that which is seasonal .Update April 30 , 2013 . I swear my truck is running much better . Almost like brand new after dumping 32 ozs in the 32 gallon tank and running it through . Now I am putting in one can . My friend  tried star brite star tron gasoline additive and swears by it . That is a little cheaper and you use 1/3 per gallon . I may try it but I can honestly say I am very pleased with this 70 year old additive that has consistently cleaned fuel systems , preserved gasoline and kept gas from separating from ethanol that picks up water . I am not one to spend money on frivolous items that do not produce . Sadly I do not drive enough miles to do a fair millage test but I would be interested if anyone has had a improvement . My friend on the star brite claims it adds about 1 to 2 mpg . I wonder if seafoam has any similar benefits ? In todays world that difference defers the cost a considerable amount . It will be hard to even try something else I have been so pleased with the Seafoam however .',\n",

       "  'text': \"I bought this under the guidance of my Smog Technician to clear up a high NOx rating for 15mph.I have a 1998 Honda Civic EX VTEC, 5 speed. The past 15 years, the car has always passed smog with flying colors (usually, all the numbers are 0 or close to it). This year, the car passed everything fine with the same record, except NOx at 15 mph. Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail. Prior years, the number was 50, with a max limit of 480 or so. This year, it went up to 780.So, I bought seafoam and, unlike a lot of other people, my car hardly smoked at all. I baby my car usually (short shift, cruise at 60-65, easy on the gas and brake and clutch) all in the name of gas mileage. With only an intake, exhaust, and headers, I average into the mid 40's for gas mileage average, when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad, but after Seafoam, the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder, I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line. This, from what I have been told, is good for a quick fix and to pass smog. I later dumped the rest of the can (2/3 left) into the gas tank. Its hard to notice, but I believe the car idles a bit easier (no gushing kind of noises). Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case, I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam. It took me a while to buy it, but it worked. 5 Stars! Worst that happens is you put it into a car that is held together by carbon deposits and your car leaks. If you car leaks oil already, or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning, don't buy this. But if you have high NOx or other figures, this is is a good buy to pass smog. Heck, once you pass smog, it doesn't matter anymore for 2 years. Cheap investment/safety net for your car.\",\n",

I was hoping I could clean it out without having to disassemble everything to get at the carb, a major pain on the Vino. I added 2 ounces of Motor Tune to a full tank, and let the scooter run for an hour. And surprise, the engine smoothed out. No more coughing and sputtering.

Pale oil is a very light, heavily refined, pale yellow oil- several sources tell me that kerosene is pale oil. And IPA is just isopropyl alcohol. Amazingly simple- you could make up your own mix, which I might just do next time. (One experimenter who did a lot of testing suggests four parts diesel fuel, 2 parts naphtha, and 1 part \"HEET\"  brand IPA.) The IPA binds to any water in the tank or fuel line, I suspect the naptha dissolves varnish deposits, and the oil is a carrier, according to a mechanical engineer I spoke with.Incidentally, I found my can on sale at the local O\\'Reilly\\'s for $4.99 for 16 ounces.

For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize, clean the gunk out of your machines, and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles, I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank, SLOOOOWLY (READ SLOWLY) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line, and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change. If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine. Don't put it in the vacuum line quickly or you will hydrolock your motor and destroy your engine. You will be fine as long as you slowly drip it.

This can lead to all sort of bad things including rough idle, corrosion, reduced power and a failure to easily start.He recommended a couple product -- SeaFoam and BG44K -- which quickly took care of the problem by helping remove the water and cleaning the valves and fuel injectors too.

But I never ran my seasonal stuff till the tank/carb was empty, I just put in some Sta-Bil and left it for ~6 months.  Now I put a couple ounces of Sea Foam in every time I fill the tank and it not only starts easier, but it starts every time.  I also noticed a difference after loading up my 12 year odl motorcycle with some Sea Foam and a clean tank of gas.  The idle was smoother and it revs smoother also.

Once all used, TURN OFF CAR.  Let sit for at least 5 minutes(preferably 15) and then turn the car back on and DRIVE IT somewhere, aggressivelybut not irresponsibly.  Do so for 20 minutes or so or at least until the smoke dissipates.Most cars don't need this treatment but I can see it on an older car or a vehicle that'sbeen abused and requires a full tune-up.Be ever mindful that the deposits you liberate from the engine may, in fact, be all thatholds the motor together.  Oil might not lubricate as well (or at all) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide (without the deposits in place) that it can't reach them.  Take care whenusing this product, and do so responsibly.Better idea: run 20% Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase (use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO), add 4 or 5ounces of it (per 10 gallons) to the fuel, and pour some down the carburetor (or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line) ) once the car is started.  Don't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly.  Run it in a new oil change: use cheap (but new) oil.  Use a cheap (but decent)  oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [the Orange Can].  Run for 2-4 weeks.  Change oil again with a good filter(Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well) and decent oil (preferably synthetic)and watch the crap drain out with the oil/Marvel Mystery Oil combo.  Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on, and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner (flush) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require.  But for those that are, it works well.  Just use correctly andresponsibly.  And beware that it may clean out exactly what was holding the motor together all thoseyears.  Still, few vehicles will have that problem.\",\n",

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will.\",\n",

What is nice about Liquid glass is that you do not need to reapply it every month to keep a great shine.Finally, I find that this is a very easy product to apply.  Follow the instructions and use the pre-cleaner the very first time you use this product and you will be good to go for a long time.  On certain colors (i.e. red) I sometimes get a bit of streaking.  Again just follow the instructions and you will find that a quick spray of water while buffing easily fixes that issue.I have no afiliation with Liquid Glass other than being an extremely satisfied customer.\",\n",

I even use this stuff on my windshield, it last longer than Rain-X while providing much better gliding action, rain just glide over the windshield. It\\'s a nice feeling not having to use wipers.It\\'s hard to write another review for an outstanding product with numerous positive feedbacks under its belt. But unlike most people I used Liquid Glass with a different approach. I used my Liquid Glass in conjunction with Blue Magic\\'s TR3 which in my opinion is slightly more abrasive, which makes it a better scratch remover & a better glazing compound than the Liquid Glass which is a better paint sealer and/or protector.My entire detail process took 2 days. Day 1 was washing & claying followed by a thorough polishing job with Blue Magic\\'s TR3. After the required 2 hrs cure for the TR3, Liquid Glass is applied with an orbital buffer that has Mequiar\\'s W8006 polishing pad attached to it.Follow instructions & let the Liquid Glass \"bake\" in the sun with ambient temp above 70 degrees for a minimum 4 hrs.  I applied a second coat on Day 2 once the ambient reaches above 70, again let it bake for 4 hrs before applying 3rd coat.The end result is complete paint restoration that looks like no other wax job unlike anything I have ever seen. My 97 Chevy Dually now looks like a new truck with a brand new layer of clear coat paint over its once dull, faded paint.For as long as you are willing to invest the time by applying multiple coats & baking it for 4 hrs in between, you will never look back at \"any\" wax, paint sealer or polish etc out there. This is indeed the best there is, my search is over.',\n",

I started cleaning the dash and the rest of the vinyl interior by using a very damp - not soaking wet, hot, and somewhat weak mild soap solution.After I removed all of the dirt and grime and the vinyl was dry, I applied the Vinylex. The vinyl interior soaked up the protectant, and I found myself with half a bottle left over after doing 1 car - but again the interior had been neglected and hadn't been detailed in a while.The spray nozzle didn't spray evenly, and after taking it apart to try to understand why, I just conceded it to be a defect. Not the end of the world - and it did function somewhat but for over ten bucks I shouldn't have to deal w/ these types of petty issues. So I simply swapped sprayheads w/ one of my own.A light, quick buffing of the vinyl thereafter applying provided the ideal amount of sheen I was hoping for.(not greasy)\",\n",

U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off.',\n",

It is  gentle, effective and provides the best shine possible, whether your car is nearly new or has 100,000 miles on it.My daily driver is an original owner, 18 year old, bright red M3, and it still turns heads because it still looks great - thanks in part to regular use of 3M hand glaze.  Here's what you do - wash your car well, using one of the better car wash solutions like Meguiar's hi-tech wash or P21S car shampoo.  Dry.  Then use Griot's Garage (or similar) paint cleaning clay to remove surface contaminants and start to work on the swirls and other imperfections in your paint.  (You can skip this step, but I've recently discovered this cleaning clay and it really does wonders, especially on cars that spend a lot of time in the woods where birds, bugs and tree sap are unavoidable).Now - get out the 3M Imperial hand glaze.  This stuff is very finely abrasive and supremely gentle on your paint - clear coat or not. Use a terry or foam applicator pad to rub the glaze into the paint and rub out fine swirls and scratches.  Work on a small section of the car at a time -- perhaps a square foot or so of surface. Always buff the glaze off, before it dries, with a best quality cotton or microfiber polishing cloth.When you're done with the 3M hand glazing process, your paint will be at its best - silky smooth and contaminant free.  It will shine as best as it knows how - but you're not finished.  This is a polish, not a protectant wax.  So now's the time to protect the paint with a high quality wax - I recommend P21S carnauba or one of the Zymol paste waxes.Follow this regimen, do it two or three times a year and keep your car washed in between. If you care about how your car looks, then year after year, you will be glad you did.\",\n",

It does have a bit of abrasiveness to it, so I wouldn't recommend using it on newer finishes.  It works ideally on older, imperfect finishes.I have a 12 year old car which I used to be very avid about keeping cleaned, vacuumed, and waxed.  Over the years I have gotten more lax about keeping the car up, even though it still looks decent.  Being outside all the time has slowly worn away the clear coat on the car, so the finish oxidizes fairly easily now.  The proper way to handle this would be a multi-stage polishing, followed by a good wax or sealant. Done correctly this takes hours and is quite tedious - even with an orbital polisher.  With this product you effectively reduce those 2-3 steps down to one.  It does an admirable job of reducing watermarks, stains, and oxidation while leaving a nice shine and protective wax coating.It can be applied easily by hand, though you'll get the maximum cleaning and polishing effect from using an orbital buffer.  It dries quickly and wipes off easily by hand.  Overall a very friendly and effective formula.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I try to keep my cars in good shape, and part of my routine is regular use of a detailing clay. A light hand and a good detailing spray (I use Meguiar\\'s) make a huge difference compared to just washing and waxing...it seems to bring the finish to life in a way that few other things do.As others here point out, detailing an entire vehicle with clay is a lot of work. Even my small cars can take me 4 hours if I do the job in one shot, so I usually do it in stages. My routine is to do one or two sections every time I wash the vehicle. One week I\\'ll do the top, hood or rear, then the next time it\\'ll be fenders or doors. Every so often, I\\'ll do the whole vehicle, but my staged approach lets me get the benefits without spending all day on the task.Compared to other clay products I\\'ve used, Meguiar\\'s seems less \"aggressive\" while still giving my car that smooth as glass finish. It also doesn\\'t leave any sort of residue, and seems to glide on and off with nothing but a hyper-smooth finish left behind.Definitely recommended, and Amazon\\'s price can\\'t be beat.',\n",

Using a stretched out 2x3 inch piece of clay along with the Meguiar's Detailing Spray for lubrication makes pretty easy work for a step that I'm not that fond of doing.  I'm always shocked at how much garbage the clay picks up from what looked like a clean paint surface.  The smoothness after going over the paint shows that this stuff is working great.  Cleaning the car with soap and water is the first step, and using the clay is definitely the necessary second step before moving on to polishing and waxing.\",\n",

I used the clay in a small area at a time, about 2' X 2' until the whole car was done and, my goodness, the surface was so smooth. I then used Meguiar's Mirror Glaze polish to smooth out some very minute scratches on the clear coat until it was spotless under a light. I finished up with Collinite Marque d'Elegance carnuba wax and the shine is blinding if the car is in the sun. I get so many compliments on my car now. It's 4 years old and I swear it looks better than the day I bought it. Also, this clay worked really well on cleaning the windshield.  After cleaning brake dust from my wheels, I used the clay and the wheels look like they just came off the assembly line.  I am very pleased. I am obsessed with keeping my auto detailed because it has been so rewarding to me to have a shiny car.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it\\'s leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can\\'t be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product\\'s diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other\\'s who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it\\'s exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn\\'t pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn\\'t have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5\" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel\\'s diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install.',\n",

But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.I use the California Duster before putting on my car cover so that there is no dust between the car and car cover. If you have a garage, it's quite useful since dust settles on the car during the day when you are out and about and at night, even garaged. You won't have to wash your car as often if you use the California Duster. And dust won't build up if you use it often enough.Before discovering the California Duster, I found that after washing my car, I could only use my car cover for a few days before the car got too dusty to put a cover over. Now I find that I can keep the car dust free and use the car cover for much longer, which in turn means I don't have to wash the car nearly as often.I got the plastic handle California Duster which was significantly cheaper at the time I ordered. Although the wood handle one looks classier and probably feels nicer, the plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy, for the value oriented, get the plastic handle one since it's the exact same brush anyway!I am really very happy with what I paid for the Calfornia Duster and would not hesitate to recommend one to anyone with a car or motorcycle. Just be aware what it is not made for a car that is wet or very dirty. My only complaint is that it is not actually made in Calfornia.\",\n",

I had gotten away from super-anal car care the last few years but with a recent purchase of a brand new 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek, my Automotive wishlist her on Amazon has been growing and another California Duster has been towards the top of the &#34;Really Want&#34; list.I still have my old Original California Duster and it works great (like fine wine, it got better with age) but was mostly interested in this smaller one for the interior.  I have a dark grey/charcoal colored interior that is patterned and almost feels 'sticky' to the touch for lack of a water word.  Using a microfiber cloth didn't really clean up the dust too well and another duster I picked up here works ok on the radio console and steering wheel but not on the dash itself.Despite a few negative reviews here I decided to give it a go after a recent price drop.  Picked this up for $4.63 when I figured I didn't have much to lose.Put it out on the porch for two days on a stack of newspapers as was suggested.  After that I gave it a bunch of really good shakes and then ran my fingers thru the fibers a few times trying to get out any of the lose ones.  That seemed to do the trick because I haven't had any issues with stray red fibers all over the place or the pad falling apart as I've read in previous reviews.Shortly after I went out to the car and cleaned the outside and the inside.  Shook it out a bunch and it seemed to work great on the dash which has been a PITA since I bought the car.  Afterwards I brought it inside and used it to dust my entire first floor of my house.  This included behind my tv and entertainment center, on top of my refrigerator and all those other places normally buried in dust.  Worked like a charm, sucked it all up and didn't let go.So I'd have to say this, just like it big brother, the Original, works like a charm.  For anyone having other issues like red fibers all over the place, I'd recommend following the steps I did listed above, it worked great for me and as of now I have a great little duster that I paid less then 5 bucks for.  IMO, u can't beat it.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'My wife was extremely pleased to find that this item is Made in Japan--both because she takes it as a sign of quality and because she\\'s Made in Japan herself.We\\'re also familiar with this kind of product in Japan, where it\\'s called a \"gum towel.\"I bought two actually, one for her and one for me to use on my bicycles--thinking it would be something like a super absorbant chamois rather than a gum towel.  It\\'s certainly super absorbant, but doesn\\'t have the chamois quality I would need to, say, polish my bike frames.  That is to say it\\'s more sticky than soft, more like a piece of foam rubber or neoprene than a cloth.So if I just hosed down the bike while cleaning and wanted to get on with the next steps of polishing and relubing, this towel is a great way to dry the bike when it\\'s neither hot nor dry enough of a day for the bike to dry out on it\\'s own in a fair amount of time.It really draws the water out too, from every knook and cranny, so no need to use DW-40 before lubing my nice clean parts.My wife uses ours for everything from picking up spills to quickly drying wet clothing that can\\'t go in the dryer.  If you wash a sweater for example, it\\'s best to roll it up in the Absorber before laying it out to dry, as this will cut your drying time to at least half and make it less of a hazard that the sweater will get out of shape.We use my far more grungy one as you might use a wet vac.  It actually does a better job than a wet vac though.Add that I\\'ve used several gum towels in Japan, mostly for swimming, and this is by far the thickest one I\\'ve used--therefore more absorbant.  And at 27\" x 17\" it\\'s big enough to be used as a bath towel without having to ring it out over and over again.BOTTOM LINE:I recommend this particular make and model over others simply based on the large size and the thickness of the towel.Don\\'t expect to use this to polish or dust, as the texture of the towel is far too sticky for that.I initially searched for the Sham-Wow on Amazon because I had seen it on TV, and still would like to try it out because it seems like it might be more chamois like--where you could wipe and polish with it.Overall, we\\'re thrilled with the quality, size, and how well this item works.

I use McGuires Fiberglass restorer and that did the most amazing removal of oxidation on an older RV I restored back to new so I knew it had to be good and tried it.I ADDED REVISED REVIEW TO END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW ON THIS PAGE.........................................................................................................................Well after applying this Flagship wax to my already clean and shiny RV it took the shine to a whole higher level. 1st off it does go on easy, once on its stays kind of moist like but drys SOFT LIKE but it comes off nice, then I follow with 2nd dry cloth to make sure its completly off and shiny and it does come off easy and it does clean finish up leaving a nice shiny glazed surface. But you need to change up rags often because it cakes and smears if you dont.I read reviews on Amazon which enticed me to give it a try. One said dont let dry any longer then 3 min and bottle claims same ( This is very true I am so pleased at results.The biggest improvment was the nice gold painted bottom of the Motorhome where the paint looked good before but now the paint looks glazed, shiny, and rich like I never was able to get this high a shine before. It also does not cling to plastic, windows or rubber everything it touches it comes off of leaving a high shine on it, So I used it on everything.NOW THIS IS MY REVISED REVIEW AS OF AUGUST 2013.

IT SHINES AS WELL BUT ALSO THE WATER STREAKS ARE MINIMAL AFTER A RAIN AND WASH OFF EASIER.I also find the protect-all brand wax to last long and come off cleaner after applying wax leaving a cleaner shine.Making it far easier to do a big RV in less time then Flagship wax. I FOUND fLAGSHIP TO BE CAKY THICK AND HARDER TO REMOVE AND HAVING TO CONSTANTLY GET FRESH RAGS TO MAKE IT EASY TO GET OFF.........So we tried it- liked it at first but then a week or so later found the flagship to not be as good as what I used for years in the Protect-all brand.

The first may be a fluke, but the something is something you should be aware of before you buy this.Issue 1) Arrived scratched, because of no protective coating.  The mirror arrived in a blister pack, which is fine, but had a lot of abrassion scratches on the front of it, which is not.  It isn't bad enough to warrant the hassle of a return, for a product this cheap, but I am certainly disappointed.  Since I only bought one, I don't know if this scratching is a trend, but I kind of suspect that it is becaus of the lack of a protective film.Issue 2) Objects in mirror are MUCH closer than they appear.  It makes things look tiny.  This may be fine if you are using this to see cars, but to see people coming from behind you in an office environmnet, it is largely ineffective.Though I usually am a big fan of buying online, from Amazon.com, this item might be better purchased in a brick and mortar store, so you can see how it will look, and ensure it isn't scratched.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I have just bought this product after using some of the cheaper ($6) leather conditioners for a while.  This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather.  You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don\\'t notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases.  I have just got a \"new\" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don\\'t go the same way.  I have to admit I\\'ve neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup\\'s tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places.  They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution.  This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases.  It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry.  Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple.  It will never return to its \"new\" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?).  It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new.  It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface.  I\\'m always sceptical about product claims (since they usually exaggerate performance), but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE (Dec 3 2009):The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well!',\n",

Ok those sandles are gone but.....Used it ever since on shoes, chairs, jackets, and any other leather.  Inherited a two hundred year old leather book.  Lexol!  Amazing difference.Motorcycle friend had old (10 yr) favorite leather jacket, think he said $600, looked poor.  Couple doses of Lexol and once again re-incarnation proven true.

My car seats definitely need Lexol Cleaner, orange bottle, first. They are darker from rubbed on grime over months of body pressure.Cleaning brightens colors AND ADDS MOISTURE. By cleaning first you remove old oils mixed with dirt when that is removed the conditioner penetrates deeper and faster. Cleaner does not work like normal soap or deterent it cleans and restores and primes leather for conditioner. Just give it a try.Its a hassle and extra work but the result is obviously better. It might even be possible to use cleaner without conditoner the cleaner moisturizes too but conditioner seams to seal the surface after it dries unlike the cleaner. You will be surprised how much dirt is on the cloth after cleaning. I change cloths positions to use new clean areas as dirt is removed. A little cleaner goes a long ways, Chairs can get quite dirty from body oils I guess.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Updated January 20, 2013I use this product on my Flexsteel leather couch, a high-quality couch.  It's a super long couch because it is actually two loveseats assembled together.  Each loveseat has an arm, one left and the other right.  Putting them together makes it one giant piece.  It's a lot of leather and that's why I bought this large container.I found that I had to buff a LOT more than I expected.  It took days for the conditioner to completely sink in after application, but I applied a heck of a lot thinking I was saving time.  You should be aware that buffing will probably be required and it will take some time for the leather to absorb the conditioner.The result is remarkable.  The color of the leather seems more vibrant and it has a shine actually.  Ultimately, this is protective of the leather and will make it last a lot longer.  In the meantime, it makes the leather look richer.One thing you will have a lot of trouble figuring out based on looking at product information for a large piece of leather furniture is what type of product should be used on it.  If you have an expensive piece, most likely there won't be instructions for this.  That's because the manufacturer doesn't want to take chances by informing you which conditioner you may use.  The retail representatives that I questioned didn't know anything about treating leather.Lexol works just fine on an expensive leather couch as my experience continues to show.  This large container goes far.  I would not waste money on small highly-branded boutique products when in my experience this product has worked perfectly on very good leather.\",\n",

I cleaned this stuff off (using the Lexol cleaner) and switched to Leather Honey. The purple's disappeared mostly but still comes back when the seats get a little wet. Not sure if the Lexol caused it, but definitely wasn't helping. The Leather Honey gets 5 stars all the way for protection, but its a bit tougher to apply.Neighbor had same problem with Lexol on their dyed leather seats.Original Review:Have custom grey Katzin leather in my Jeep Wrangler, a bit over 1 yr old as of this posting.When I talked to the installer about care and likelihood of getting wet (either mud or rain), he mentioned a good quality conditioner should help mitigate any potential damage and suggested Lexol. I apply the Lexol conditioner about once/month, using the same rag which has become good and saturated over time.I've had a few bouts with mud over the last year or so, and each time the Lexol cleaner followed up with the conditioner works great, even after a few days of mud drying/caking on the seats.Last weekend, I left the doors and top off and got a good rain over night. I walked out in the morning to tie dye looking leather seats (a combination of purple/pink/grey) and about an inch of water pooling in each... Within a few hours the leather returned to normal color and after a quick coat of lexol, look brand new again. Highly recommend this product.\",\n",

All 5 spray leather cleaner and conditioner are priced between $7-9 for a 16 FL ounce bottle. This one is actually 16.9 FL OZ and cheaper than some of the other brands, so a good value.2. This one has no particular scent, which I prefer.3. The bottle holds nicely in the hands, it's very ergonomically designed.4. The spray nozzle is the nicest and best (big, sturdy, fine mist) of all the spray bottles I have tried.5. Since this is a cleaner only, you should follow with a leather conditioner (also stated on the back of the bottle), which I find a bit of a hassle. I'm a busy working mom and prefer to use a leather cleaner and conditioner in ONE, such as as the WhooHoo-CleanLeather Conditioner and Cleaner in One. Luxurious Leather Lotion for Your Designer and Fine Leather Goods. Protect Your Leather Investment. 15 FL OZ. Made in USA!.6. Because it's in a spray format, it's good for large leather items such as a sofa, which I used it for. For smaller and more expensive leather goods, I prefer to use the WhooHoo-Clean leather care. If I pay several hundred or thousands of dollars for a leather item, I want to keep it new looking for a long time!In my opinion, any real leather can and will benefit from a good leather care product (with high customer reviews!). Think about it, leather is like skin, it will get dry with time and particularly usage. Just pick one that fits your budget and use it regularly!\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I torture-tested this product on a big black Lincoln Town Car Signature L that emerged from the winter with the old wax stripped off by time, weather and automatic car washes. This is a car I detail by hand during the warmer seasons, so I decided to try Liquid Glass when it came time to revitalize the finish.The most appealing characteristics of Liquid Glass are ease of use, lack of residue, durability, and its ability to repel water and road dirt. This is possibly the easiest product to remove that I have ever used. You can apply it to the entire car in just about any conditions and buff it off very easily, although you may have some white powder floating around if you apply it too heavily. It doesn't stain plastic or rubber parts, so you don't have to worry much about where you apply it. Liquid Glass repels water so well that I can just about dry the car completely with the exhaust from my shop vacuum, with just a little help from a microfiber cloth. Its water-repelling properties make it useful to apply to all the glass on the car as well as the painted parts.Starting with essentially bare paint, I didn't find that a single coat of Liquid Glass was enough to produce the results I wanted, but two applications did the trick. I also tried a third coat to see what would happen, but additional benefits weren't apparent. (Each coat was applied on a different day to allow the product time to cure.) Liquid Glass produced a good shine, but the results didn't surpass what I've achieved with other quality products. Since I didn't have time to do any polishing, I wondered whether Liquid Glass would have some cosmetic effect of filling in swirl marks, but it didn't seem to do as much as some other products in this respect. There also wasn't an exceptional depth to the shine it produced on a black car. My impression is that the Liquid Glass finish is hard and durable, but on the thin side. It does, however, produce a slick finish that repels water and road dirt very well, so that sometimes I only need to rinse the car with water and blow it dry instead of washing it.Liquid Glass is a good product in many respects, and I intend to get my money's worth from the can I bought. The jury is still out as to whether I'll buy more or try something else.UPDATE: The product I ultimately decided to stick with is Turtle Wax Ice Liquid Polish. It's a synthetic polish with all the benefits of Liquid Glass that I described above. However, it's even easier to use than Liquid Glass, more economical, and produces a better-looking result. Unlike Liquid Glass, Turtle Wax Ice actually has some ability to mask swirl marks, and it produces a deeper shine.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new. I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Lexol Vinylex Protectant SprayLexol makes a variety of quality car care products, and Vinylex is no different. I've used their leather cleaner, leather protectant, and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success, so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant, which I have used for over 12 years with good success. Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation. It's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate, plastic car trim, dashboards, steering wheels, center consoles, and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696. It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell. There are no streaks either. However, I don't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes. It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well, so there's probably some ingredients that settle. However, I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out. I just use old (but clean) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex. The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard. When I tried Armor All products and even 303, it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out. The 303 also had an odd smell, whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free. I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall: 5/5 stars, highly recommended. I feel Vinylex is better than 303 Aerospace Protectant, but only time will tell after I observe the actual UV protection capabilities.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'I decided to give this stuff a try after watching a video featuring a professional detailer. He suggested to use this stuff and to NEVER use anything by Armor All because the greasy film produces a greenhouse effect, trapping all the rays the sun puts out and basically cooks the plastic, causing premature aging, cracking, etc.. I foolishly started using Armor All about 3 years ago because it made the plastic in my car look really nice and had a deep, rich black color it was starting to lack. But then I gave Vinylex a try and once I removed the Armor All that was previously applied, I noticed that my circular air vents actually turned a little white. I can only assume the AA caused that. So I stripped all my interior plastic of the AA and used Vinylex and, depending on how much you apply, leaves a really nice matte finish with a slight bit of sheen, but with no glare in the windshield. The AA wipes I used, even if I wrung them out, still left a highly reflective shine on the dash.The best way I found to apply Vinylex is to take a good quality microfiber towel, fold it and then spray about 3 good squirts, rub it in and that should cover a whole door panel with ease. Then switch to a clean side of that microfiber and kinda wipe off or buff some of the wetness you may get on the plastic. Also use it on interior weather stripping where the doors shut-- mine were looking spotty with water and almost chalky, simply because I never bothered to clean them. The Vinylex made them look dark black and brand new. I have access to this stuff because the Toyota dealer I work at sells it and a lot of it. I\\'ve honestly never seen it anywhere else. My first impression of Vinylex was, \"Eh, it\\'s a cheap product, I can guarantee it\", simply because of it\\'s outward appearance. Trust me, it\\'s good stuff.A co-worker of mine also uses the Lexol leather cleaner and conditioner for his leather couches.',\n",

I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won\\'t be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O\\'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4\\'s is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15\" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In \\'the old days\\' I bought wrapped \\'stinky\\' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this \\'new and improved\\' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful \\'new car smell\\' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI.',\n",

If you want something that smells like top grain Italian leather this is not the product nor the price range you need to be looking for and it definitely isn't the expectation you should have if you paid less than $20 for a product.  For that price you get what you get,  regardless of what the manufacturer may claim. Reviewers on Amazon kill me with unrealistic expectations like products that are purchased at low costs like this one should be perfect and expensive grain leather is unrealistic and ignorant.  A nice cover it is.  Top grain leather it is not, at least not for $20. Want top quality?  Spend multiples of the cost of this product! !!! I like mine and itinstalled in a snap.\",\n",

I needed to lubricate the spindles on my mower so I obtained a grease cartridge and tried to load it into the gun by following the manual provided by Lincoln. I appreciate the fact that Lincoln furnished a manual but I would have been pleased if it had been written clearly enough to be understood. I simply could not load the cartridge using the Lincoln manual and decided to look for other instructions.

It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck.\",\n",

It will then never come loose or fall out.  All craft work is deserving of our best efforts. Give it the respect it deserves by doing your best, and by using the best tools and materials.\",\n",
